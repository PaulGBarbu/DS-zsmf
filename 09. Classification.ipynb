    "    - Popular algorithms: Decision Trees, SVM, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes\n",
    "- **Multi-Class Classification**: more than two class labels, \n",
    "    - e.g. plant species\n",
    "    - Popular algorithms: Decision Trees (XGBoost), kNN, Naive Bayes\n",
    "    - SVM/Logistic Regression can be used, if problem is adapted to One-vs-Rest/One-vs-One\n",
    "- **Multi-Label Classification**: >=2 class labels, one or more class labels for each observation\n",

    "Special issues in case of strongly imbalanced class distributions e.g. Fraud Detection.\n",
    "- **Approach 1**: Change composition of the observations in the training data aka undersample the majority class or oversample the minority class\n",
    "- **Approach 2**: Use specialized algorithms for modelling, that pay more _attention_ to the minority class"
