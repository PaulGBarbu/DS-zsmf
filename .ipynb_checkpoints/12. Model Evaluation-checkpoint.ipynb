    "## Profit Chart\n",
    "The Profit chart shows the expected profit dependent on amount of sold abalones. As it can be seen the linear SVM for example can be completely profitable up until about 80%. After that point false positives become more common. All graphs fall below zero at the end because if all abalones are sold it's a net negative business. Meaning, this graph shows us up until which point the model is profitable.\n",

    "1. Predict the probability for (e.g. positive) using the model and arrange the observation in the decreasing order of predicted probability (most likely to the least likely)\n",
    "2. Divide the data sets into smaller data sets (e.g. deciles) calculate the number of positives in each subset and the cumulative number of positives up to a subset\n",
    "3. **Gain** is the ratio between the cumulative number of positive observations up to a subset to the total number of positive observations in the data. The gain chart is a chart drawn between the gain on the vertical axis and the subset on the horizontal axis.\n",
    "4. **Lift** is the ratio of the number of positive observations up to a subset $n$ using the model to the expected number of positives up to that decile $n$ based on a random model. Lift chart is the chart between the lift on the vertical axis and the corresponding subset on the horizontal axis \n",
